# Organization Starter Template

A standardized starter template for organization projects. This repository provides a pre-configured structure, documentation, and CI/CD workflows to ensure consistency and best practices across all projects.

## Repository Structure

- `src/`: Source code for the project.
- `docs/`: Project-specific documentation.
- `config/`: Configuration files (e.g., environment variables, build settings).
- `tests/`: Automated test suites.
- `.github/workflows/`: Automated CI/CD pipelines for linting and testing.

## Getting Started

### Using This Template

1.  Click the **"Use this template"** button on GitHub.
2.  Choose a name for your new repository.
3.  Clone your new repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/organization/your-new-project.git
    ```
4.  Navigate to the directory:
    ```bash
    cd your-new-project
    ```

### Initial Setup

1.  Update `README.md` with your project's name and description.
2.  Review and customize `CONTRIBUTING.md` and `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`.
3.  Initialize your package manager (e.g., `npm init` or `poetry init`).
4.  Standardize your code style by configuring the provided `.editorconfig`.

## CI/CD Workflows

The template includes two GitHub Actions workflows:
- **Lint**: Runs automated linting checks on every push and pull request.
- **Test**: Runs automated tests on every push and pull request.

Ensure you update these workflows to match your project's specific linting and testing commands.
